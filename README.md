Key Features:
1. Mobile-First Design: The layout is specifically designed for mobile devices, with each screen sized for an "iPhone 14 Plus".


2. Clear Information Hierarchy: The page uses distinct sections like "WHAT WE SELL" and a clear structure for each product, displaying the item's name, price, and a prominent "Order Now" button.


3. Consistent Component Design: Each product card follows a consistent design pattern, featuring an image, product name, price, and a "like" icon, which makes the interface predictable and easy to navigate.
